-----------------------

All files in this folder were generated by the GPSIO installer.

The only file in this folder that you may rarely need to edit
is gpsio-host.ini.


Architecture overview
---------------------

The web browser extension sends messages to and receives messages
 from the nativeMessagingHost named 'com.caltopo.gpsio'.

The Windows Registry specifies that com.caltopo.gpsio messages
 should look at chrome-manifest.json or firefox-manifest.json in
 this folder to see what to do next.

chrome-manifest.json and firefox-manifest.json specify the name
 of the host file (gpsio-host.bat) that should be run each
 time communication is needed.

gpsio-host.bat invokes dist\gpsio-host\gpsio-host.exe which
 is the product of 'pyinstaller gpsio-host.py'; it's
 a python script which can be run as an .exe file so that no
 full python installation is needed.

gpsio-host.py (and therefore gpsio-host.exe) communicates with
 the extension using stdio.  It makes calls to GPSBabel to
 communicate with older GPS devices, and to combine multiple
 imported files from newer GPS devices into one stream of data.
 Garmin USB drivers are required to communicate with the older
 GPS devices.

The GPSIO installer takes steps to check for all of these
 components, and install them individually as needed.  The
 installer also changes registry settings and file contents
 as needed to ensure all parts are working with each other
 as spelled out above.
