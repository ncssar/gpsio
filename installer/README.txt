-----------------------

All files in this folder were placed or generated by the GPSIO installer.

The only file in this folder that you may rarely need to edit
is gpsio-host.ini.


NOTE: GPSIO does not currently communicate with MTP devices.
 Some very new Garmin devices may use MTP to communicate with the
 computer - these will show up in the Windows file navigator as
 any other drive, but, the MTP device will not have a drive letter.


Architecture overview
---------------------

The web browser extension sends messages to and receives messages
 from the nativeMessagingHost named 'com.caltopo.gpsio'.

The Windows Registry specifies that com.caltopo.gpsio messages
 should look at chrome-manifest.json or firefox-manifest.json in
 this folder to see what to do next.

chrome-manifest.json and firefox-manifest.json specify the name
 of the host file (gpsio-host.bat) that should be run each
 time communication is needed.

gpsio-host.bat invokes dist\python.exe to run the python script
 gpsio-host.py.  The dist folder is the unmodified 'Windows
 embedded package' downloaded from python.org.  It provides a
 standalone, minimal, complete python interpreter.

gpsio-host.py communicates with the web browser extension using
 stdio.  It makes calls to GPSBabel to communicate with older GPS
 devices, and to combine multiple imported files from newer GPS
 devices into one stream of data. Garmin USB drivers are required
 to communicate with the older GPS devices.

The GPSIO installer takes steps to check for all of these
 components, and install them individually as needed.  The
 installer also changes registry settings and file contents
 as needed to ensure all parts are working with each other
 as spelled out above.
